        "detail":"Antarctica lies around the South Pole, mostly below the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. The continent is huge—over 14 million square kilometers (about 5.5 million square miles)—almost twice the size of Australia and similar in area to Pluto. Its coastline stretches nearly 18,000 kilometers (11,200 miles). Most of this coast is covered in thick ice shelves, while other parts are steep ice cliffs, glaciers, or bare rock. Although Antarctica looks like an endless sheet of ice, it also has rivers and lakes. The Onyx River is the longest, and Lake Vostok is the largest subglacial lake, hidden beneath the ice near Russia’s Vostok Station. Scientists believe the water in Lake Vostok is slowly renewed as ice melts and refreezes, roughly every 13,000 years. In summer, some lake edges melt a little, forming temporary pools of liquid water. Both saltwater and freshwater lakes exist on the continent. Antarctica is divided into East and West by the Transantarctic Mountains, which stretch from Victoria Land to the Ross Sea. Almost the entire landmass is buried under a massive ice sheet, averaging nearly two kilometers thick. Only a few ice-free areas remain, mostly near the coasts, such as the McMurdo Dry Valleys. Ice streams from the sheet flow outward into huge floating shelves, slowly moving ice from the interior to the ocean.",

Antarctica covers more than 14.2 million km2 (5,500,000 sq mi), almost double the area of Australia, making it the fifth-largest continent, and comparable to the surface area of Pluto. Its coastline is almost 18,000 km (11,200 mi) long:[1] as of 1983, of the four coastal types, 44% of the coast is floating ice in the form of an ice shelf, 38% consists of ice walls that rest on rock, 13% is ice streams or the edge of glaciers, and the remaining 5% is exposed rock.[15] The lakes that lie at the base of the continental ice sheet occur mainly in the McMurdo Dry Valleys or various oases.[16] Lake Vostok, discovered beneath Russia's Vostok Station, is the largest subglacial lake globally and one of the largest lakes in the world. It was once believed that the lake had been sealed off for millions of years, but scientists now estimate its water is replaced by the slow melting and freezing of ice caps every 13,000 years.[17] During the summer, the ice at the edges of the lakes can melt, and liquid moats temporarily form. Antarctica has both saline and freshwater lakes.[16]Antarctica is divided into West Antarctica and East Antarctica by the Transantarctic Mountains, which stretch from Victoria Land to the Ross Sea.[18][19] The vast majority of Antarctica is covered by the Antarctic ice sheet, which averages 1.9 km (1.2 mi) in thickness.[20] The ice sheet extends to all but a few oases, which, with the exception of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, are located in coastal areas.[21] Several Antarctic ice streams flow to one of the many Antarctic ice shelves, a process described by ice-sheet dynamics.[22]",
